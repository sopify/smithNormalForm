This program takes a matrix over the integers and transforms it into its Smith normal form, a.k.a. invariant factor form. Smith form for matrices over the integers is useful when studying the structure of finitely-generated abelian groups, or solving linear equations over the integers.

More on Smith form: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_normal_form

Eventually, I will add functionality to input matrices from the Terminal, or if the user wishes, from a text file. For now, you'll have to manually type in the size and entries of the matrix.

I hope you enjoy!
